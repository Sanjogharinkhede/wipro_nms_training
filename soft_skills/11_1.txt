-----------------

We should monitor and modify our expressions be it oral or written to sound 
assertive and polite because communication is an interpersonal skill. 
The chances of these three elements are very high:
1)Misunderstanding
2)Misinterpretation 
3)Miscommunication


For example: If you watch Youtube videos like Vlogs on Food or Travel or Education - 
The ability of the presenter to gather information, communicate through verbal and non-verbal is Soft element
 while the video is also attractive due to some other reasons
 like editing, infographics, audio settings, pictographics, clarity settings, etc.
 which is Hard element. So, now tell me friends, is it not important for a professional to have
 both soft and hard skills to be competent in this world?
 

An example could be Stand up comedy where a comedian/presenter put 
some hardskills (more likely audio systems,stage, post editing, promotian content).
while soft skills like immediate humor, audience engagement,timing of jokes, and
improvisation as per audiences. both makes a better show

Yes, Of course both the Soft skills and the hard skills are very important to survive especially in this competitive world. 
Having only a single skill is not enough to sustain for a long time. 
For example, consider a tech reviewer. He/she have to possess both the skills to make the content engaging and reach to the wider audience.
 If he/she keeps on saying the specs of a particular gadget without showing any visual/pictorial presentation,
 the viewers might feel bored and might skip the video. So both Soft and hard skills are very important.

The combination of soft and hard skills is crucial for professionals to excel in today's world.
 Soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability, enable individuals to interact effectively
 with others and navigate complex social environments. Hard skills, like technical proficiency, data analysis, and specialized knowledge, 
provide the expertise needed to perform specific tasks.

In a music concert, the singer’s ability to engage the audience, express emotions, and perform confidently shows soft skills,
 while their vocal techniques, breath holding techniques understanding of musical instruments, and stage setup reflects hard skills. 
so it is a sum effect of all soft and hard skills which gives us pleasure whille listening the music Soft skills, like communication and teamwork,
 help people connect and work smoothly. Hard skills, like technical expertise or hands-on knowledge, get the actual job done. Together,
 they’re essential—soft skills create harmony and understanding,
 while hard skills ensure quality work. Without both, success and effectiveness are harder to achieve.
